# JavaScript30 #22: follow-along-links
This is a JavaScript practice, one of the JavaScript30 challenges by Wes Bos. </br>

### General Info

In this project, links are highlighted and highlights take size of actual widths and heights of the links as links are hovered on. <br><br>
In order to get the element's size, element.getBoundingClientRect() method is used since it returns a DOMRect object providing information about the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.
